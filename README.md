# Language Translator using OpenAI GPT-3.5

This is a simple language translator application built using Python's `tkinter` library for the GUI and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for translation. The application allows users to input text, select a source and target language, and translate the text in real-time using OpenAI's GPT-based model.

## Features
- Translate text from one language to another using OpenAI's GPT-3.5.
- Supports multiple languages for both source and target languages.
- Simple and clean user interface using `tkinter`.
- Error handling for invalid inputs and translation errors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI Python SDK (`openai`)
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- OpenAI API key (you need to sign up and get an API key from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-translator-openai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd language-translator-openai
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

4. Set your OpenAI API key:
   Open the `language_translator.py` file and set your OpenAI API key in the following line:
   ```python
   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python language_translator.py
   ```

2. Enter the text you want to translate in the input box.

3. Select the source language (e.g., English) and the target language (e.g., Hindi) from the dropdown menus.

4. Click the **Translate** button to generate the translated text.

5. The translated text will appear in the output box.

Purpose

1. **Language Translation**: The main purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple way to translate text between different languages using OpenAI's GPT model.
2. **GUI with `tkinter`**: The user interface is built using the `tkinter` library, which is a standard Python library for building desktop GUIs.
3. **Input and Output**: The user inputs text into a text box, selects the source and target languages, and gets the translated text in the output box.
4. **API Call**: When the user clicks the "Translate" button, the text and selected languages are sent to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 model for translation.
5. **Error Handling**: The code has error handling to manage situations like empty input or API call failures.
